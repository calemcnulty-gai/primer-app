# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Project Structure

This project follows a standard directory structure:

```
project_root/
 |-- .cursor/              # Cursor AI assistant configuration
 |     |-- rules/          # Composable rules for Cursor
 |     |-- project_plan.md # Task tracking
 |     |-- changelog.md    # Project changes log
 |
 |-- app/                  # Main application code
 |-- components/           # Reusable components
 |-- constants/            # Application constants
 |-- hooks/                # Custom React hooks
 |-- assets/               # Static assets
 |-- README.md             # This file
```

## Cursor Rules

This project uses a composable rule system for the Cursor AI assistant following Geoffrey Huntley's approach from [https://ghuntley.com/stdlib/](https://ghuntley.com/stdlib/). Rules are stored in `.cursor/rules/` and can be included in custom instructions using `@file:.cursor/rules/main.mdc`.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
